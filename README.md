# Image_Caption_AI

**Image_Caption_AI** is a web application that generates descriptive captions for uploaded images using a deep learning model. It combines a ResNet18 image encoder and a Transformer decoder to produce natural language descriptions. Built with Flask, the app offers a clean interface for users to interact with the model.

## Features

- Upload an image and receive a caption generated by a neural network.
- Learn about the model architecture on the About page.
- View API documentation for integration into other applications.
- Responsive and modern UI.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mirhasidheek7213/Image_Caption_AI.git
   cd Image_Caption_AI
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Add model files**

Place `best_tested_model.pt` and `vocabulary.json` in the root directory.

5. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

App will be available at: [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)

---

## Usage

1. Open [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)
2. Upload an image using the upload button or drag-and-drop.
3. View the generated caption.
4. Visit the About page to learn how the system works.
5. Visit the API page for integration instructions.

## How It Works

- **Image Encoder**: ResNet18 extracts visual features.
- **Caption Decoder**: Transformer generates captions from features.
- **Beam Search**: Optimizes caption quality.
- **Interface**: Built with Flask, styled with CSS, and includes drag-and-drop support via JavaScript.

---

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Deep Learning**: PyTorch (ResNet18 + Transformer)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
